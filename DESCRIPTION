Description: Implements a Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic record linkage model that allows for missing data
    and the inclusion of auxiliary information. This includes functionalities to conduct a merge of two 
    datasets under the Fellegi-Sunter model using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition, 
    tools for preparing, adjusting, and summarizing data merges are included. The package implements methods 
    described in Enamorado, Fifield, and Imai (2019) ''Using a Probabilistic Model to Assist Merging of 
    Large-scale Administrative Records'' <doi:10.1017/S0003055418000783> and is available 
    at <http://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/linkage.html>.
